Signal is a file transfer app. Suppose you have a file that you want to send to your friend (for example, 3 GB). You have to upload a 3 GB file and your friend has to download 3 GB. There must also be a server that stores the file. There are several problems:
1. The security of the server where the file is stored

2. High internet usage (6 GB in total)

3. A lot of time is spent

But in the signal with Peer-to-peer connection, only the person who wants to download the file needs to use the Internet. Also, the file is not stored anywhere.

Put the files you want to make available for download to others in the `files` folder, then run `main.py` and make the link available to those you want.
